# signlang

Sign Lang is a tool that converts sign language into text using the OpenCV library and a pre-trained deep learning model. The model is trained on a manually collected custom dataset of all the hand-signs used in the alphabets of the sign language
The pre-trained classification model (keras_model.h5) used in the test.py script was generated using Teachable Machine, a tool provided by Google. The model was trained to recognize hand gestures based on a set of labeled training images. The corresponding label file (labels.txt) provides the mapping between the model's predicted indices and the actual gesture labels.
